## How blood characteristics can influence an athlete

Do blood hemoglobin concentrations of athletes in endurance-related events differ from those in power-related events? This is the question which we are looking answers for. Hemoglobin is an iron-containing protein in the blood of many animals (in the red blood cells, erythrocytes, of vertebrates) that transports oxygen to the tissues such as muscles as in this analysis. The major difference between power and endurance sports is that they use a different energy system as their major source of fuel. Oxygen is used by these systems, and therefore, blood hemoglobin should be present in higher amount for endurance athletes. The dataset used is the Australian Athletes Dataset which comprises 202 observations of 13 different variables. It is used to study the relationships between hemoglobin and other blood such as hematocrit as well as physical features such as body mass. After exploring a variety of models, a Bayesian network constructed with the Hill- Climbing (HC) algorithm minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) score is selected as final model. It is evaluated through k-fold cross-validation and bootstrap. The applications of this research are many. Among them, the athlete could take appropriate action to ensure their hemoglobin concentrations are at optimal levels when performing by modifying different aspects of his/her preparation.
